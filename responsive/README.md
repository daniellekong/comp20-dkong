# comp20 lab responsive design

README.md Lab 4, COMP 20, Danielle Kong, 2/12/17

All aspects of the assignment have been implemented - the HTML has not been changed and responsive.css has all the styling to display the correct part of the image depending on the browser screen width.

I worked on the assignment independently and spent approximately 2 hours on it.
