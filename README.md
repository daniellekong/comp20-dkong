README.md Lab9, COMP 20, Danielle Kong, 4/21/17

1. What is this purpose of this Git repository?
This repository contains the assignments and labs I did for COMP 20 (Web Programming), taught by Ming Chow in Spring 2017.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was #2, the Black Car Service. While I initially struggled with this assignment, I learned a lot about asynchronous JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest. I also previously had not had experience using a third-party JavaScript API and it was cool to learn more about the Google Maps API.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
The course itself has taught me a lot about web programming that I previously was unfamiliar with. I am also more confident in my abilities to find ways to solve a programming problem and to learn by myself - from searching for advice and tips online to asking others questions when I am unsure about something. Further, I have a much better grasp of front end and back end concepts.

4. What was the most important thing that you have learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
A big takeaway for me is having a good understanding of what happens when you type a web address into your browser and press enter. Before, I did not understand this process at all - I just knew what I needed to do to get to a certain page. Assignment #3 (creating the server for the locations of passengers and vehicles) helped me to understand what happens on the server side. Lab #2, where we dissected HTTP responses and request headers, was also very helpful to my understanding. 

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I am interested in learning more about web security after the little introduction we've been given in COMP 20. It's very relevant and a big issue in today's world.
